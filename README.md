# personal-website

This is a personal website constructed by Nathan Yocum. It runs a lot of
what I learned during the Reno Microsoft Hackathon. This includes:

* Node/npm
* apollo-express
* Graphql
* Postgres

In addition, some of my goals for this project:

* Learn deployment to AWS, Heroku, or Azure
* Construct a frontend using React.js
* Learn testing (probably Jest)
* Use webpack
